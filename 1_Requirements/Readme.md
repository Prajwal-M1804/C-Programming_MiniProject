# Introduction
Tic-Tac-Toe is a well known game played by two
persons who alternately place X's and O's upon a 3x3 playing field.
The players first decide who will mark his moves
with an X and who will go first. Play proceeds with the opponents
alternately placing their marks in any unoccupied cell 
The object of the game is to be the first player with 3
marks in a row, where a row can be either vertical, horizontal, or
diagonal. If all the cells become filled the game is a draw.
